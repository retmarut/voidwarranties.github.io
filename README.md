# voidwarranties.github.io
VoidWarranties static website is using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator with [Github pages](https://pages.github.com). Reasoning:
* Github is hosting, so no hosting costs for us and good uptime
* can add/edit pages through Github using markdown, cfr. a CMS
* well documented and everything is in Github by design
* use Jekyll for templating, so it's more powerful than a static website (e.g. default template with navbar)
